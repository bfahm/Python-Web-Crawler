# WikiCrawler

### Project Dependencies:

- Python 3.7
- Beatiful Soup
- Requests

Running the script will find a random article, parse it to find its body and start "Crawling" till it finds the page titled: Philosphy.

Though the Crawler doesn't navigate any external non normal links, it might get stuck in a loop.
